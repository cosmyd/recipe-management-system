# Recipe Management App  

---

## Description
This is a JavaFX app that allows users to create and manage
their own recipes. I build this app as a university project
for the Object Oriented Programming and Databases courses.  
The app has the following features:
- Users can create an account (requires only username and password)
- They can log in and create their own recipes selecting from the available 
ingredients, specifying amounts, writing descriptions of the recipes
- They can also edit and delete recipes at any time
- Users can add any ingredient to a Shopping List while viewing
a recipe, and remove them once they buy them
